## Description

3. Open the file index.html in your default browser.

## Usage
1. Open index.html in the default browser to view the website properly.
2. Click the 'Add Task' button and fill in the title, description, and due date in the modal.
3. If the task is overdue, the background of the card is red, and if it's for today, the background is yellow.
4. Drag the card to move it from the to-do lane to any other lane as the task progresses.
5. Delete the task if needed by clicking the delete button.
6. Refresh the page to ensure that the cards remain.
